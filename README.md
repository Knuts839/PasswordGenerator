# PasswordGenerator
The assignment went really well. The validation testing of the application is definitely the most tedious part of the assignment in my opinion. After testing you have a non-zero chance of not getting a character set you select especially at low password lengths. The constraints I have placed in the code to make sure user puts in a valid password length is pretty solid. The most time consuming part of the assignment in terms of building the generator was getting that 8-128 character prompt solid.
