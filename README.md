# PasswordGenerator
This application required validation so that the user was forced to request at least and 8-character password and no more than a 128-character password. The password generator had to have user choice of four-character sets (numbers, Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, and special characters). In these yes or no prompts for the various cases I included validation that forces the user to write y for yes or an n for no and had a line of code that if the user wrote an uppercase y or n it would just be forced to lowercase and considered a valid response. For anything that required a user response I had code for validation to make sure it was correct if not I would just give them that same prompt again. The technologies used were JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I created a password generator using JavaScript. Key requirements included:

• Password length >= 8 characters and <= 128 characters

• User choice of at least one of four-character sets (numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters). I provided users with Yes (Y) or No (N) prompts to indicate choice.

• I wrote validation code to ensure that user responses conformed to requirements.
